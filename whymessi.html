  <h1>Why messi?</h1>
  <div>

    <p>I decided to choose messi because he is one of my favorite soccer player and well i have love and passsion for the sport.evryytime he makes a mistake its motivates me beacuse the way he takes it the way people hate on him and the way he deals with it is incredible he doesnt fight back with voilece or anger he fights back with his skills and will to keep going and he shows people that what they say about him really doesnt matter and that as long as he is still on that feild nothing will get to him.</p>
<p> all the pressure all the illnesses all the pain all the losses all the horrible horrible things that happens or is going to happen messi will not stop playing he doesnt do it for the fame or money everything he does is not for publicityy he does it for his own good for his family for his fans when he scores he does it for his team when he plays he does it for the joy not for the money he is motivated and determined to give everyy pactie every game 100 percent no matter what.</p>

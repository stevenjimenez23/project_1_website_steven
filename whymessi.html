  <h1> Why messi?</h1>
  <div>
    <h2> inspiration</h2>
    <p> This page is going to be about why i decided to choose messi for the topic of my webpage.Now i know alot of people might not like messi well because they just hate on people for no reason and well probably beacuae they like ronaldo but thats a whole diffrent story.So i chose messi becuase the way he plays on the feild motivates me to play harder every time i have practice and games just to give it 100 percent and he just not cocky compared to other players</p>
    <h2> motivate me</h2>
<p> evrythng he has gone through evrything he had to do sacrifice just for the pride the sport not for the fame nor money just for the love and pride soccer gives him.evytime you see him on the feild practice or not he will be giving it his all no matter what the circumstace is hes hurt he will push through it theres not many people like that not even aot of players like that and this is why i chose him..He is a insperation to people all over the worl especially to me and my family and im happy to say if it wasnt for him and my fam i wudnt be the soccer player iam tday..</p>

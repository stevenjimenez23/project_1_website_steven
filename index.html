    <h1> MESSI </h1>

    <div>
    <h2> BY: STEVEN </h2>
      <p> Messi is in my opinion the best in the world whhen it comes to soccer.Not only becuase his love for the sport is strong but for his dedication and mindset to keep playing and trying no matter what.When he plays when he is on the feild playing he indpires people all over the world just by the way he plays.he had some ups and downs frowing up and this website is going to explain it all.</p>
        <p> Im doing this project on messi because i love soccer and he is one of the best.When he plays he motivates not only me but thee world  Some people hate on messi beaccuse there a bit of a rivary between 2 amazing players messi and ronaldo.I honestley like both but i prefer to support messii because ronaldo is really cocky and messsi just plas not for the ffame but for the pride the joy and passion.</p>
